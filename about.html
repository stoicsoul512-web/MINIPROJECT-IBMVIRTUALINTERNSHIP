                <p>Hi, I am Vishnupriya Vunukonda, a Computer Science student at Anurag University, and I am currently working on a mini project for my IBM Virtual Internship. Ever since I started coding, I have been fascinated by how lines of code can create interactive, dynamic experiences on the web. This project gives me the chance to combine my technical knowledge with creativity, and see ideas come to life in a tangible way.

                    I have experience in C++ and Java, and I am diving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some Python. While I am still perfecting my Python syntax, I enjoy the challenge of learning new languages and experimenting with different ways to solve problems. Every project I work on teaches me something new, whether it is debugging tricky code or finding better ways to design a user interface.

              Beyond programming, I am a determined and independent learner. I enjoy reading books out of pure curiosity.Through this portfolio, I want to share my journey, my growth, and the projects I am proud of. Each project reflects not just what I know, but how I think, experiment, and push myself to do better. I am excited to continue building, learning, and creating solutions that challenge me and maybe even inspire others along the way.
